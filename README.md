# Challenge-1-No-ifs-no-buts-Toy-Problem-
In this implementation, we first calculate the difference between a and b using the subtraction operator -. We then use logical operators && to check if the difference is greater than, smaller than, or equal to zero. If the comparison is true, we return the corresponding string "greater than", "smaller than", or "equal to". Otherwise, we return nil.

Next, we use the || operator to select the first non-nil value among greater, smaller, and equal. If greater is non-nil, we return "#{a} is greater than #{b}". If smaller is non-nil, we return "#{a} is smaller than #{b}". If equal is non-nil, we return "#{a} is equal to #{b}".

Note that we're not using the if keyword or the ternary operator ? anywhere in this code. Instead, we're using logical and comparison operators to perform the comparison and return the result as a string.
